# Tracker settings for BoT-SORT
tracker_type: botsort  # required

# Detection thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.20     # Upper confidence threshold to start tracking
track_low_thresh: 0.05      # Lower confidence threshold for keeping track
new_track_thresh: 0.75      # Confidence threshold for starting new track

# Matching and buffer settings
track_buffer: 90            # Number of frames to keep lost tracks
match_thresh: 0.85          # IoU threshold for matching detections to existing tracks
fuse_score: True            # Whether to fuse object score with re-ID similarity

# Global motion compensation (GMC)
gmc: False                  # Important to include, even if False
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow   # Method for GMC

# Appearance matching
proximity_thresh: 0.5       # Distance threshold for considering appearance
appearance_thresh: 0.25     # Re-ID similarity threshold
with_reid: True             # Whether to use Re-ID module
fast_reid: True             # Needed if using Ultralytics' default re-ID model

# Optional but often expected to avoid internal errors
ablation: False             # Needed if using custom config

# (Optional, custom extensions like yours)
size_ratio_thresh: 0.8      # Your custom extension — fine to keep if you check for it in code
iou_thresh: 0.5             # Your custom extension — same as above
